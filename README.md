# NLP-Based Auto Use Case Diagram Generator
Welcome to the NLP-Based Auto Use Case Diagram Generator project! This innovative tool leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically generate use case diagrams from textual descriptions. It's designed to assist software engineers, system analysts, and project managers in visualizing system functionalities and interactions efficiently.
### Features
- **NLP-Powered Analysis:** Automatically extract actors, use cases, and relationships from natural language descriptions.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive interface for easy data input and diagram customization.
- **Customizable Templates:** Adapt existing templates or create new ones to match your project needs.
- **Export Options:** Save diagrams in various formats such as PNG, SVG, and PDF.
- **Integration:** Easily integrate with other software development tools and platforms.

### Usage
1- **Input Data:**
- Enter your system's textual description in the provided input field. The NLP engine will analyze the text to identify actors, use cases, and their relationships.

2- **Generate Diagram:**
- Click the "Generate Diagram" button to create the use case diagram based on the extracted information.

3- **Customize and Export:**
- Use the customization options to modify the diagram’s appearance as needed.
Export the finalized diagram in your preferred format.

## Libraries and Algorithms
### Libraries
1- **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK):**

- Used for tokenizing, tagging, and parsing text. NLTK provides essential tools for processing the textual input and extracting relevant entities.
2- **spaCy:**

- An advanced NLP library that offers robust features for named entity recognition (NER), dependency parsing, and part-of-speech tagging. spaCy helps in identifying actors and use cases from the text.

### Algorithms
1- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):**

- Utilizes spaCy’s pre-trained models to detect and classify entities in the text, such as actors and use cases.
2- **Dependency Parsing:**

- Analyzes grammatical structure and relationships between words in a sentence, aiding in understanding how actors and use cases interact.
3- **Text Tokenization:**

- Breaks down the input text into individual tokens (words and punctuation) using NLTK, which is the first step in the NLP pipeline.
4- **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging:**

- Assigns parts of speech to each token using spaCy, helping to distinguish between different types of entities and actions.
5- **Relationship Extraction:**

- Custom algorithms developed to identify and map relationships between actors and use cases based on the parsed text.
